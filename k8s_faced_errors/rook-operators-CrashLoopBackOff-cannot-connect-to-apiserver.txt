    Last State:     Terminated
      Reason:       Error
      Message:      Get https://10.96.0.1:443/api/v1/namespaces/rook-ceph/configmaps/local-device-k8snw03: dial tcp 10.96.0.1:443: connect: no route to host

The route problem can be solved by flush iptables.

systemctl stop kubelet
systemctl stop docker
iptables --flush
iptables -tnat --flush
systemctl start kubelet
systemctl start docker
